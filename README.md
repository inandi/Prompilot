2. Go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X / Cmd+Shift+X)
3. Search for "PromptPilot"
4. Click Install

### First Steps

1. **Find the Button**: Look for the PromptPilot icon in the bottom-right corner of VS Code (status bar)
2. **Add Your First Prompt**: Click the button and select "Add New"
3. **Fill in the Details**:

4. **Use It**: Click the button again, select your prompt, and it's copied to your clipboard!

## 📖 How It Works

### Creating a Prompt

When you click "Add New", you'll be asked for three things:

1. **Short Name**: A memorable name for your prompt (like "Code Review" or "Explain Function")
2. **Detailed Instruction**: Your complete prompt text - you can paste multi-line text here
3. **Scope**: 
   - **Global**: Available in all your VS Code workspaces
   - **Project-specific**: Only available in the current project

### Using Your Prompts

1. Click the PromptPilot button in the status bar
2. You'll see all your prompts listed alphabetically
3. Click on any prompt to copy it to your clipboard
4. Paste it (Cmd+V / Ctrl+V) into your AI chat

### Managing Prompts

At the bottom of the prompt list, you'll find a "Manage" section where you can:
- **Edit**: Update an existing prompt
- **Delete**: Remove prompts you no longer need

## Tips & Tricks

- **Organize by Project**: Use project-specific prompts for project-specific instructions
- **Use Global Prompts**: Save your most common prompts as global so they're always available
- **Short Names Matter**: Keep names concise and descriptive - you'll see them in the list
- **Multi-line Support**: You can paste complex, multi-line prompts - they're fully supported!
